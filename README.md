Most users won't want to compile Jamulus from source as these scripts do. Usually, you should use the official Debian/Ubuntu repository as described on the [Linux installation page on jamulus.io](https://jamulus.io/wiki/Installation-for-Linux)

In contrast, this repository is for scripts to allow unattended upgrades by compiling Jamulus **from source**. Usage examples would be to allow automatic upgrades for Raspberry Pi, server images or other systems without using the official repository to have full control over the produced binaries.
